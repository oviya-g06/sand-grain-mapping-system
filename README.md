#  Sand-Grain-Mapping-System

## üìñ Project Overview
This project is being developed for a hackathon. Our goal is to create a low-cost, automated system to classify beach sand grain size using computer vision. The system uses a camera to capture images of sediment and a machine learning model to predict the grain size category. It also incorporates a GPS(GNSS) module to log the geographic coordinates of each sample.

##  Key Features
*Image Classification:Uses a Deep Learning model to classify sand into categories (e.g., fine, medium, coarse).
*GPS Integration: Logs the latitude and longitude for each analysis.
*Automated Pipeline: Designed to be run on a portable device (like a Raspberry Pi inside a rover) for on-site analysis.
